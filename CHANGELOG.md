[TOC]

This changelog contains a non-exhaustive list of new features and notable bug-fixes (not all bug-fixes will be listed). 


<br/><br/>
# DTWC v1.0.0

## New features
* HiGHS solver is added for open-source alternative to Gurobi (which is now not necessary for compilation and can be enabled by necessary flags). 
* Command line interface is added. 
* Documentation is improved (Doxygen website).

## Notable Bug-fixes
* Sakoe-Chiba band implementation is now more accurate. 

## API changes
* Replaced `VecMatrix<data_t>` class with `arma::Mat<data_t>`. 

## Dependency updates:
* Required C++ standard is reduced from C++20 to C++17 as it was causing `call to consteval function 'std::chrono::hh_mm_ss::_S_fractional_width' is not a constant expression` error for clang versions older than clang-15.
* `OpenMP` for parallelisation is adopted as `Apple-clang` does not support `std::execution`. 

## Developer updates: 
* The software is now being tested via Catch2 library. 
* Dependabot is added. 
* `CURRENT_ROOT_FOLDER` and `DTWC_ROOT_FOLDER` are seperated as DTW-C++ library can be included by other libraries.

# DTWC v0.3.0

## New features
* UCR_test_2018 data integration for benchmarking. 

## Notable Bug-fixes
* N/A

## API changes
* DataLoader class is added for data reading. 
* `settings::resultsPath` is changed with `out_folder` member variable to have more flexibility. 
* `get_name` function added to remove `settings::writeAsFileNames` repetition)
* `std::filesystem::path operator+` was unnecessary and removed. 

<br/><br/>
# DTWC v0.2.0

A user interface is created for other people's use. 

## New features / updates
- Scores file with silhouette score is added. 
- `dtwFull_L` (L = light) is added for reducing memory requirements substantially.  

## API changes
- Problem class for a better interface. 
- `mip.hpp` and `mip.cpp` files are created to contain MIP functions.

## Notable Bug-fixes
* Gurobi better path finding in macOS. 
* TBB could not be used in macOS so it is now option with alternative thread-based parallelisation. 
* Time was showing wrong on macOS with std::clock. Therefore, moved to chrono library.

## Formatting: 
- Include a clang-format file. 

## Dependency updates
  * Required C++ standard is upgraded from C++17 to C++20.

- Mixed-integer programming solution support via YALMIP/MATLAB. 
- Support for `*.csv` files generated by Pandas.  

## Dependencies
