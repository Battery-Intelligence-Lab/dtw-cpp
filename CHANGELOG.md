# Unreleased

## Tests

* Added cross-language integration tests (`tests/integration/test_cross_language.py`): verifies C++ and Python interfaces produce identical results for DTW distances (L1/squared-euclidean, banded, missing-data), compute_distance_matrix, FastPAM/CLARA clustering, DTW variant consistency (DDTW/WDTW/ADTW/Soft-DTW), checkpoint save/load roundtrip, and end-to-end pipeline (data -> distance matrix -> clustering -> evaluation scores).

## Examples

* Added Python examples: `04_missing_data.py` (NaN-aware DTW), `05_fast_clara.py` (scalable clustering), `06_distance_matrix.py` (fast pairwise computation with timing), `07_checkpoint.py` (save/resume distance matrices).
* Added MATLAB quickstart example: `bindings/matlab/examples/example_quickstart.m` (DTW distance, distance matrix, clustering).
* Added C++ new-features example: `examples/example_new_features.cpp` (DTW variants, missing data, FastCLARA, checkpointing).

## Documentation
* Fixed DTW formula in `docs/2_method/2_dtw.md`: changed from squared L2 `(x_i - y_j)^2` to L1 `|x_i - y_j|` to match actual code implementation.
* Fixed pairwise comparison count: corrected from `1/2 * C(p,2)` to `C(p,2) = p(p-1)/2`.
* Fixed warping window description: band=1 allows a shift of 1 (not equivalent to Euclidean distance); band=0 forces diagonal alignment.
* Fixed spelling errors: "seies" -> "series", "wapring" -> "warping", "assertain" -> "ascertain".
* Added note clarifying that the default pointwise metric is L1 (absolute difference).
* Added z-normalization section with note that population stddev (N, not N-1) is used.
* Added `docs/2_method/5_algorithms.md`: clustering algorithm documentation with corrected FastPAM citation (JMLR 22(1), 4653-4688) and accurate complexity descriptions.
* Added `docs/2_method/6_metrics.md`: distance metrics documentation with LB_Keogh compatibility table and corrected Huber LB_Keogh reasoning.

## New features

* Added **MATLAB MEX bindings** — new `bindings/matlab/` directory with C++ MEX API gateway and MATLAB `+dtwc` package: `dtwc.dtw_distance`, `dtwc.compute_distance_matrix`, `dtwc.DTWClustering`. Build with `cmake .. -DDTWC_BUILD_MATLAB=ON`.
* Added **checkpoint save/load** for distance matrix computation (`save_checkpoint`, `load_checkpoint`). Saves partial or complete distance matrices to disk as CSV + metadata text file, enabling resume after crashes.
* Added `count_computed()` and `all_computed()` methods to `DenseDistanceMatrix`.
* Added `distance_matrix()` accessors and `set_distance_matrix_filled()` to `Problem` class.
* Added Python bindings for `save_checkpoint`, `load_checkpoint`, and `CheckpointOptions`.
* Added **DTW with missing data** (`dtwMissing`, `dtwMissing_L`, `dtwMissing_banded`). NaN values contribute zero cost. Supports L1/SquaredL2, early abandon, banding. Reference: Yurtman et al. (2023), ECML-PKDD.
* Added `dtw_distance_missing` Python binding.
* Added **FastCLARA** scalable k-medoids clustering (`dtwc::algorithms::fast_clara`). Subsampling + FastPAM avoids O(N^2) memory. Reference: Kaufman & Rousseeuw (1990); Schubert & Rousseeuw (2021, JMLR).
* Added Python binding for `fast_clara()`.
* Added `MetricType` parameter (L1, SquaredL2) to all core DTW functions. Template lambda dispatch for zero inner-loop overhead.
* Refactored DTW into `detail::*_impl` helpers with distance callable template parameter.
* Added `metric` parameter to `dtw_distance` Python binding.
* Added `compute_distance_matrix` Python function with OpenMP parallelism.
* Added `distance_matrix_numpy()` method to `Problem` Python class.
* Added `-ffast-math` (GCC/Clang) and `/fp:fast` (MSVC) for Release builds.
* Added **Google Highway SIMD infrastructure** (`DTWC_ENABLE_SIMD` option, default OFF). Prototype kernels for future use.
* Added `#pragma omp simd` hints to LB_Keogh and z_normalize.
* Added LB_Keogh, z_normalize, envelope benchmarks.
* Added `DTWClustering` sklearn-compatible Python class.
* Added core type system (`dtwc::core` namespace).
* Added FastPAM1 k-medoids clustering algorithm.
* Added z-normalization, lower bounds, DenseDistanceMatrix, pruned distance matrix.
* Added Google Benchmark integration.

## Architecture

* Removed Armadillo dependency from all hot-path code.
* Replaced `arma::Mat` with `core::ScratchMatrix` and `core::DenseDistanceMatrix`.
* Unified `FastPAMResult` with `core::ClusteringResult`.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed `DenseDistanceMatrix` NaN sentinel broken under `-ffast-math` / `/fp:fast`. Replaced with boolean vector.
* Fixed `throw 1` bare integer throw — now throws `std::runtime_error`.
* Fixed `static std::mt19937` ODR violation — changed to `inline`.
* Fixed `.at()` in hot DTW loop — replaced with `operator[]`.
* Fixed `dtwBanded` 512MB/thread allocation — rolling buffer.
* Fixed `fillDistanceMatrix` integer overflow at N>46K.
* Fixed `dtwBanded` template default from `float` to `double`.
* Fixed `static` vectors data race in `calculateMedoids`.
* Fixed DBI formula.
* Fixed broken examples.
* Renamed `cluster_by_kMedoidsPAM` to `cluster_by_kMedoidsLloyd`.
* Fixed z_normalize tests.

# DTWC v1.0.0

## New features
* HiGHS solver is added for open-source alternative to Gurobi (which is now not necessary for compilation and can be enabled by necessary flags). 
* Command line interface is added. 
* Documentation is improved (Doxygen website).

## Notable Bug-fixes
* Sakoe-Chiba band implementation is now more accurate. 

## API changes
* Replaced `VecMatrix<data_t>` class with `arma::Mat<data_t>`. 

## Dependency updates:
* Required C++ standard is reduced from C++20 to C++17 as it was causing `call to consteval function 'std::chrono::hh_mm_ss::_S_fractional_width' is not a constant expression` error for clang versions older than clang-15.
* `OpenMP` for parallelisation is adopted as `Apple-clang` does not support `std::execution`. 

## Developer updates: 
* The software is now being tested via Catch2 library. 
* Dependabot is added. 
* `CURRENT_ROOT_FOLDER` and `DTWC_ROOT_FOLDER` are seperated as DTW-C++ library can be included by other libraries.

# DTWC v0.3.0

## New features
* UCR_test_2018 data integration for benchmarking. 

## Notable Bug-fixes
* N/A

## API changes
* DataLoader class is added for data reading. 
* `settings::resultsPath` is changed with `out_folder` member variable to have more flexibility. 
* `get_name` function added to remove `settings::writeAsFileNames` repetition)
* `std::filesystem::path operator+` was unnecessary and removed. 

<br/><br/>
# DTWC v0.2.0

A user interface is created for other people's use. 

## New features / updates
- Scores file with silhouette score is added. 
- `dtwFull_L` (L = light) is added for reducing memory requirements substantially.  

## API changes
- Problem class for a better interface. 
- `mip.hpp` and `mip.cpp` files are created to contain MIP functions.

## Notable Bug-fixes
* Gurobi better path finding in macOS. 
* TBB could not be used in macOS so it is now option with alternative thread-based parallelisation. 
* Time was showing wrong on macOS with std::clock. Therefore, moved to chrono library.

## Formatting: 
- Include a clang-format file. 

## Dependency updates
  * Required C++ standard is upgraded from C++17 to C++20. 

<br/><br/>
