# Method

This software tackles the clustering problem using [Dynamic Time Warping](2_dtw.md) as the distance metric and [mixed integer programming](3_mip.md) or [k-Medoids](4_k-Medoids.md) for the clustering solution. The fundamentals of each of these techniques are described in this methods section. Additionally users can read the [JOSS publication](../5_publications/joss_paper.md) for more information on the method and useful references.
