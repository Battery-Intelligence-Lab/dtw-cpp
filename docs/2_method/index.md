# Method

DTW-C++ clusters time-series data using [dynamic time warping](2_dtw.md) to compute distance metrics, and [mixed integer programming](3_mip.md) or [k-Medoids](4_k-Medoids.md) for clustering. The fundamentals of each of these techniques are described in this methods section. Additionally, users can read our [journal article](../5_publications/joss_paper.md) for more information and relevant references.
