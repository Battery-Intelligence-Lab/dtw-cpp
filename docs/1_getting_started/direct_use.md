# Direct use

Although DTW-C++ is easiest to use via the command line interface executable, it can also be used directly as follows:

- Install [the dependencies](dependencies.md).
- Download the source code and extract it if it is zipped.
- Copy your data into the `data` folder in one of the [supported data formats](supported_data.md).
- Edit `main.cpp` in the `dtwc` folder using the examples in the `examples` folder or [examples page](examples.md).
- Compile the code using [these instructions](run.md), and after compilation use the `dtwc_main` executable located in the `./dtw-cpp/bin` folder.
