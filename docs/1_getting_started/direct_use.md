# Direct use

Although DTWC++ is not recommended to be directly used, it is the easiest way to use the library. 

- Install [the dependencies](dependencies.md).
- Download the source code and extract it if it is zipped.
- Dump your data into `data` folder in one of the [supported data formats](supported_data.md).
- Edit `main.cpp` in `dtwc` folder using the examples in `examples` folder or [examples page](examples.md).
- Compile using instructions in [running](run.md) page and use `dtwc_main` executable after compilation.
