# Supported Data Formats

DTWC++ currently supports importing data from a limited range of data structures. It is primarily equipped to read files or folders into a one-dimensional dataset. Consequently, if your data is multi-column, it will be necessary to omit some columns or rows to retain a single column format.

## Reading Data from Disk

You can specify either a _file path_ or a _folder path_ for your data. The software accommodates `*.csv` and `*.tsv` file extensions.

### Specifying a File Path

A _file path_ can direct to a file containing your data in variable-length rows. The values might be separated by commas, tabs, or spaces. In this scenario, time-series names are allocated sequentially from 1 to N.

**Example:** A file with 5 time-series of varying lengths:

|       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 43.87 | 48.98 | 27.60 | 49.84 | 75.13 | 95.93 |       |       |       |
| 38.16 | 44.56 |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
| 76.55 | 64.63 | 65.51 | 6.10  | 29.11 | 13.86 | 81.43 | 25.11 |       |
| 79.52 | 70.94 | 16.26 | 58.53 | 69.91 | 14.93 | 24.35 | 61.60 | 12.71 |
| 18.69 | 75.47 | 11.90 | 22.38 |       |       |       |       |       |

### Specifying a Folder Path

A _folder path_ can contain multiple files, each representing a separate dataset. Data in these files are read column-wise. If a file contains multiple columns, it's necessary to omit some to extract the last column. The values may be separated by commas, tabs, or spaces. In this case, time-series names are derived from the file names.

**Example:** A `file.csv` with two columns separated by a comma. Note that files without headers (such as those generated by Pandas) will display `,0` for the first row. To access the actual data points in such files, specify `skipRows=1` and `skipColumns=1`.

|   |   |       |
|---|---|-------|
|   | , | 0     |
| 0 | , | 43.87 |
| 1 | , | 48.98 |
| 2 | , | 27.60 |
| 3 | , | 49.84 |
| 4 | , | 75.13 |
| 5 | , | 95.93 |

## Reading Data Yourself

If you are using DTWC++ as an API within your software, you might prefer to read the data independently or utilise pre-generated data. DTWC++ employs the `Data` class to encapsulate a `std::vector<std::vector<data_type>>` data object and `std::vector<std::string>` for their corresponding names. The following example code snippet demonstrates how to input data into a Problem object.

```cpp
// Your data generation routine:
std::vector<std::vector<double>> myData = generate_some_data();
std::vector<std::string> myNames = generate_some_names();
//-------------------------------

// Create a Problem object:
dtwc::Problem myProblem{'problem_name'};
auto myDataObject = dtwc::Data(std::move(myData), std::move(myNames));
myProblem.set_data(myDataObject);
/* Other settings */
```
