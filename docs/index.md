# About DTW-C++

_DTW-C++_ is a package for time series comparison and clustering. The algorithm uses [dynamic time warping (DTW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) to calculate distance metrics between pairs of input time series. For clustering, users can choose between a method based on either mixed integer programming or k-medoids. Please read through the  documentation on this website to learn how to use DTW-C++. It is recommended to use the software through the command line interface, however direct calling of the code is also possible.

This code has been developed at the Department of Engineering Science of the University of Oxford.
