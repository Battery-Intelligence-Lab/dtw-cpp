# About DTWC++

_DTWC++_ is a package for time series analysis and clustering. The algorithm ultisies dynamic time warping (DTW) as a distance metric to compare the similarity of input time series. For the clustering method, users can choose between using mixed integer programming (MIP) or k-Medoids. Please read through the following documentation to learn how to use the software. It is reccomended to use the software through the command line interface, however direct use of the code is also an option.

This code has been developed at the Department of Engineering Science of the University of Oxford.
