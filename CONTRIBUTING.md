DTW-C++ is an open-source project open to both academic and commercial applications. We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and features. We welcome and appreciate any contributions from the community.

## Opening issues

We use GitHub issues to track all bugs and features. Feel free to open an issue if you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvements. If an issue has been closed but you believe it still needs attention, please re-open it.

## Pull requests (PRs)

If you have a solution to an issue, we welcome [GitHub pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) from the community.

1. Open an issue describing the problem your PR will address, if one does not already exist. Outline your approach to solving it.
2. We do not have a contributor license agreement yet; but please just agree that your contributions will be publicly open. 
3. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
4. Code your solution. Please do not forget to read the [coding conventions](develop/conventions.md)!
5. Squash your commits into a single commit with a clear message describing the PR.
6. Include tests that verify the changes introduced by your PR. Ensure that your tests cover the bug fixes or new features thoroughly.
