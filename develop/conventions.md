## Coding Conventions:

- Do not use "using" in global namespace.
- First include standard headers then our headers.

## Versioning: 

We use semantic versioning with MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH where:

- PATCH: Backwards compatible bug fix without introducing a new feature. 
- MINOR: Backwards compatible new feature. 
- MAJOR: Incompatible changes, especially on API. 

See [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvPiZyx0cDc) for a detailed tutorial on versioning. 

### Commenting: 

We have recently activated our Doxygen pages and realised that not all comments in our source files are Doxygen compatible. However, we are trying our best to adapt our comments. Please feel free to fix any imcompatible comments you see. 

- Please see the commenting guidelines in https://doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html
