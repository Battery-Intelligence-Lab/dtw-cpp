# DTW-C++

DTW-C++ is a dynamic time warping (DTW) based clustering library in C++. The user can input multiple time series (potentially of variable lengths) and the number of desired clusters if known or a range of possible cluster numbers if not known. DTW-C++ can cluster the time series using k-Medoids or mixed integer programming (MIP). k-Medoids is generally quicker but may be subject to sticking in local optima, whereas MIP can find globally optimal clusters. ANY DEPENDANCIES?
